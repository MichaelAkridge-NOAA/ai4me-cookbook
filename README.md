Useful information and code to help open science AI/ML efforts for marine ecosystems

###  Workshop | Part 1
Workshop Goals: 
- Equip users with a shared understanding of AI/ML workflows and fundamentals
- Define how annotations fit into the model lifecycle
- Build & train basic models using marine datasets.
- Explore training results and graphs.
- Deploy models

## Agenda (Draft)
#### 1. AI/ML Basics / Overview
- Quick primer on object detection pipeline (data → annotation → model training → deployment)
- Role of annotations in model performance (importance of quality & consistency)
- Where to find data, resouces, and so on?
#### 2. Models, Data & Annotation Strategies & Tools
- Best practices for efficient annotation workflow
- Review tools(CVAT, Label Studio, Viame) and discuss pros/cons
- Discuss integrating QA/QC checks and techniques
#### 3. Hands On | AI/ML Development Exercises & Examples
- Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
- Annotation 
- Dataset Prep
- Model Development & Training
- Model Deployment
### 4. Model Deployment 
### 5. Q&A / Roundtable
### Next Steps
