# Role of Annotations in Model Performance
- A core pillar of model performance
- Annotations the ground truth that the model learns from

## Machine Learning = 80% Data Management + 20% Model Building 
#### “In machine learning, 80% of your time is spent preparing and cleaning the data, and only 20% of the time is spent on the actual model building.”  - Andrew Ng (former Stanford AI Director/Professor)

- Poor or inconsistent annotations can lead to poor performance, while high-quality annotations can significantly improve accuracy.
