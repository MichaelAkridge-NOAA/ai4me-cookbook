# AI/ML Model Lifecycle

###  AI/ML is Non-Linear
#### 1. Performance of the model and its output is not proportional to the input. Not just data input, but effort as well.

#### 2. Experimentation is key. Try:
- different architectures
- tune hyperparameters
- test different training techniques like data augmentation or different optimizers
