# Getting Started
Useful information and code to help open science AI/ML efforts for marine ecosystems

## Workshop Brainstorm
### Workshop Goal: TBD
- Equip the team with a shared understanding of object detection workflows
- define how annotations fit into the model lifecycle
- develop a clear plan to maximize team efficiency

### Workshop Prep -  Clarify objectives/goals, priorities, and expectations.
- What is the overall strategy for object detection in ESD/ARP
  - how can we use our team most effectively
- What are primary object detection use cases
  - Urchin
  - ESA Corals
  - So on
- How is the annotation team currently being used
  - What are the current challenges
  - annotation scenarios examples
- What decisions need to be made regarding annotation tools, formats, or workflows?
- Are there specific datasets, models, or deployment goals?
- Intrest in more deep dives/hands-on sessions?
- timeline for integrating object detection into operational workflows
