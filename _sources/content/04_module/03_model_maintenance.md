# Model Management 

## Model Version Control using Hugging Face with Git
Hugging Face provides a Git-based system (like Github) for managing model versions, making it easy to track changes, collaborate, and deploy updates efficiently. Each model repository on Hugging Face operates like a Git repository, allowing you to push updates, create branches, and maintain different versions.

- Branches: You can use branches to develop new features, experiment with different training strategies, or maintain stable and experimental versions of your model (e.g., main, dev, v1.0, v2.0).
- Commits & Tags: Every push to the repo creates a new commit, ensuring version history is preserved. You can use tags to mark specific model releases (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).
- Pull Requests: If working in a team, you can use pull requests to review and merge changes, similar to GitHub workflows.
Model Card Updates: Along with model weights and configurations, you can update the README.md (model card) to document changes in each version.
