# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- helps you understand dataset
- detect potential issues 
- and refine preprocessing steps

## Some Common EDS Tasks
- View image properties (dimensions, color channels, aspect ratios)
- Check annotation format (bounding boxes, segmentation masks, class labels)
- Understand class distribution (balance of object categories)
- Check for missing or corrupt data (empty annotations, unreadable images)

## Build in QA/QC in the pipeline 
> Quality assurance and Quality control (QA/QC)
- Review samples batches of annotated or predicted data
- Use automated tools to spot common errors
- Have another person double-check the annotations
