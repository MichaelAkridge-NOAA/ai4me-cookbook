# Role of Annotations in Model Performance

## Machine Learning = 80% Data Management + 20% Model Building 

### “In machine learning, 80% of your time is spent preparing and cleaning the data, and only 20% of the time is spent on the actual model building.” 
- Andrew Ng (former Stanford AI Director/Professor)
