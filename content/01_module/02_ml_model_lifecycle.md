###  1. AI/ML is Non-Linear
#### Performance of the model and its output is not proportional to the input. Not just data input, but effort as well.

### 2. Experimentation is key. 
- try different architectures  
- try and tune [hyperparameters](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/hyperparameter-tuning/)
- test different training techniques like data augmentation or different optimizers
