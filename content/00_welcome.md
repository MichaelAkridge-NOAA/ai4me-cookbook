# Welcome to the AI4ME Cookbook
## AI for Marine Ecosystems (AI4ME)
Useful information and code to help open science AI/ML efforts for marine ecosystems

###  Workshop | Part 1
Workshop Goals: 
- Equip users with a shared understanding of AI/ML(object detection) workflows and fundamentals
- Define how annotations fit into the model lifecycle
- Build and train basic models using marine datasets.
- Explore training results and graphs.

## Draft Agenda
